# AI-Powered Online Exam Proctoring Platform

A secure, intelligent online exam system combining live proctoring with behavior monitoring to ensure academic integrity. This platform provides a smooth and scalable way to conduct online tests while deterring cheating using real-time face and object detection.

## ✅ Features at a Glance

- Real-time webcam stream monitoring

- Face recognition using face_recognition and dlib

- Alert if multiple faces are detected

- Phone detection using YOLOv8 object detection

- Exam termination upon suspicious activity

- Activity logs saved to suspicious_activity_log.txt

- Role-based login (Student, Admin/Proctor)

- Django-admin interface for exam setup and user management

## 💡 Motivation

With the shift to remote education, ensuring exam honesty has become a growing challenge. Manual proctoring is tedious and limited. This platform leverages AI to offer:

- Automated violation detection

- Real-time monitoring without human invigilators

- Smooth integration with frontend/backend
