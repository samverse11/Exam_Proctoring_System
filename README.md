# AI-Powered Online Exam Proctoring Platform

A secure, intelligent online exam system combining live proctoring with behavior monitoring to ensure academic integrity. This platform provides a smooth and scalable way to conduct online tests while deterring cheating using real-time face and object detection.

## ✅ Features at a Glance

- Real-time webcam stream monitoring

- Face recognition using face_recognition and dlib

- Alert if multiple faces are detected

- Phone detection using YOLOv8 object detection

- Exam termination upon suspicious activity

- Activity logs saved to suspicious_activity_log.txt

- Role-based login (Student, Admin/Proctor)

- Django-admin interface for exam setup and user management

## 💡 Motivation

With the shift to remote education, ensuring exam honesty has become a growing challenge. Manual proctoring is tedious and limited. This platform leverages AI to offer:

- Automated violation detection

- Real-time monitoring without human invigilators

- Smooth integration with frontend/backend

## ⚙️ Installation Guide (Tested on Python 3.10.8)

⚠️ Note: dlib requires Python 3.10.8 and CMake ≥ 3.22. Make sure these are properly installed.

1️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/samverse11/Exam_Proctoring_System.git
cd Exam_Proctoring_System

2️⃣ Set Up Virtual Environment

python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate    # On Windows
### OR
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS

3️⃣ Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

If you face issues with dlib, manually build it:

cd testing/dlib
python setup.py install

## 🧍‍♂️ Face Reference Setup

To enable face recognition, add a clear frontal image of the test-taker in the `/testing/` folder.

- Name the file exactly: `person1.jpg`
- This image will be used for real-time face matching during the test.
- Example: `testing/person1.jpg`

## 🧪 Django Setup

Run the Following:

python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser

## 🚀 Running the System

###  Terminal 1: Start Django Server

python manage.py runserver

###  Terminal 2: Launch Proctoring Module

cd testing
python app.py

When a student begins the exam, the proctoring window opens and starts real-time monitoring using webcam feed.
